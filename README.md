Reflection: I spent too long on this project because I went against the instructions that said not to be a perfectionist. On the plus side, at least the page looks good, and I got some practice with HTML and CSS, and I enjoyed making the page. I used gifs for the video previews because I don't know JavaScript yet. I also got some practice with Flexbox, which I didn't use on the Google homepage project â€“ however, the page still looks bad on mobile. Another big drawback is that neither the Google homepage nor the Google search results page can actually be used to make a google search.
